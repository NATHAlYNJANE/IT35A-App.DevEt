1. Objective

The proposed application, EcoConnect, aims to bridge the gap between sustainable initiatives and local communities by providing a platform for individuals and organizations to collaborate on eco-friendly projects. The app will serve as a hub for education, action, and impact tracking, empowering users to contribute meaningfully to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

2. Key SDGs Targeted

The app primarily aligns with the following SDGs:

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - Promotes community-led sustainability projects and local eco-initiatives.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - Encourages sustainable practices through educational content and resource-sharing.

SDG 13: Climate Action - Provides tools to track and reduce carbon footprints, fostering climate-conscious behaviors.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals - Connects individuals, NGOs, and businesses for collaborative sustainability efforts.

By integrating these SDGs, EcoConnect contributes to global sustainability efforts by offering a digital ecosystem that facilitates real-world impact.

3. Key Features

Sustainability Projects Hub: Users can create, join, and manage sustainability projects with real-time collaboration tools.

Educational Resources & Gamification: Interactive learning modules and rewards for sustainable actions encourage continuous engagement.

Carbon Footprint Tracker: A personalized dashboard helps users monitor and reduce their environmental impact.

Community Networking: A built-in forum enables knowledge sharing, discussions, and collaborations among users.

Impact Metrics & Reporting: Organizations can track and report the impact of their sustainability initiatives using data visualization tools.

4. Technical Architecture

A detailed technical architecture diagram will be created using Miro and included in the final submission. The high-level architecture includes:

Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile compatibility)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js (REST API services)

Database: MongoDB (for scalability and flexibility)

Cloud Hosting: AWS/GCP (for reliable infrastructure)

APIs: OpenWeather API for climate data, Google Maps API for location-based services
